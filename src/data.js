       "Repaired a hit and run on my 2016 honda civic ex. Family members have previously given this location business and I was very satisfied with my overall experience. I also had a personal dent that owner provided me a package deal with reducing my overall insurance deductible. As a courtesy because the bumper was prepared but not installed, a free detailing (250$ worth) was provided for the additional time required. I highly recommend this location; reliable, honest, solid work. Muchas gracias para servicios senor!!",
